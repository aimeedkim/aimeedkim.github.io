      This program ties the <u>quilting process</u> with the <u>coding process</u>. Each quilt patch represents a code function, which can be assigned from a variety of provided functions, and different stitch types carry different pre-assigned values. The fabric patches can be combined in any direction. 
      <br><br>
      To assign an ability to the patches, you have to hand-sew the fabric patches together, but you can test a variety of different orientations and functionalities before you do. Our program will be able to recognize any textile patch, enabling quilters to use any found material they choose. 
      <br><br>
      The program will provide users with a variety of forms to play and experiment with. Once the function has been assigned, the user will have the option of having the function and respective value displayed on the surface of each patch. 
      There is also the option of applying a collection of functions from a database of other quilts onto one patch, enabling quilt coders to sample and build off of one anotherâ€™s artworks. As the quilter works, the virtual product will appear in the space around them via an AR headset. 
      This program is highly process oriented and is meant to bridge the perceived gap between two remarkably similar creation processes.

      Some people might focus more on the quilt, while others on the virtual product and we are trying to encourage an appreciation of the relationship between the two. 
      Our Computational Quilts program is meant to encourage experimentation in a way that is atypical of coding, as well as providing a non-linear approach to an otherwise linear language.
